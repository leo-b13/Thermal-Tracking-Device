-Tracking Device Processing is code to be used in the Processing Application to display the data from the GridEYE. 
  This requires serial data so data must be printed in the serial monitor each loop.

-Epsilon is the main version. This was designed to work with an ESP32 mini microcontroller. The pinout is seen below.
