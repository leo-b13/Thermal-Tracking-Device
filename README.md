-Tracking Device Processing is code to be used in the Processing Application to display the data from the GridEYE. <br/>
  -This requires serial data so data must be printed in the serial monitor each loop. <br/>
  -Sometimes the processing code will not upload due to a NaN error. Just keep trying to upload it (maybe 3-5 times) and it should upload succesfully. <br/>

+Epsilon is the main version. This was designed to work with an ESP32 mini microcontroller. The pinout is seen below.
